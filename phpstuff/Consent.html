<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Consent
</h1>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Anything that involves randomly assigning patients to

    two groups – even if the two treatments are in routine

    use – requires consent. Doing anything to a patient

    that isn’t “routine” or widely accepted requires consent

    UNLESS it’s clearly for quality assurance purposes

    (gets tricky). </li>

    <li>Having patients undergo even a totally risk-free

    “special” exam preop or postop (e.g. neurocognitive

    testing) requires consent, even if there is no alteration

    in treatment. The key is “special”. </li>
</ul>
