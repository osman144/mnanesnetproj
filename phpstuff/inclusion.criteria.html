<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Inclusion Criteria
</h1>

<p>
    Usually straightforward – but important.


    EXACTLY what kind of patients are you going to study (or
    whose records do you want to review)?


    Age? Gender? Specific operations? Specific diseases?




    Again, unambiguous, specific and measurable. And
    don’t forget “time factors”, e.g. “We want to look at adult
    males that have undergone X procedures between Jan 1,
    2005 and Dec 31, 2010.
