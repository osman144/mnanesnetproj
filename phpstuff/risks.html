<p>This is a big deal. But what you want are “the

    specific risks of the study”, not “the expected

    regular risks of the operation that you are studying”.
<ul>
    <li>If you are looking at two different ways of measuring body

    temperature in patients having craniotomies, the risk of

    “neurologic complications” IS NOT a risk of the study (unless,

    I suppose, you were sticking a temperature device in the

        brain itself).</li>

    <li>This is one reason for the comments about “routine care”

    noted above. If you’re measuring blood pressure via a

    routinely place arterial catheter, then the possible

    complications of placing an arterial catheter ARE NOT a risk

        of the study.</li>
