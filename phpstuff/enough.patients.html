<p>
    <ul><li>This is something often overlooked. For example,
    you’re really interested in postoperative length of stay
    in elderly (age >80) males having inguinal hernia
    repairs? Assume you want to know the median LOS
    within ± 5% (with 95% confidence).</li>

<li>
    As noted above, this would require gathering data on
    over 300 patients. Do we really have 300 patients
    available to us? And what happens if you need to
    exclude some patients (not eligible)?</li>

<li>
    To answer this question, you will always need to do
    some homework.</li>
</ul>
