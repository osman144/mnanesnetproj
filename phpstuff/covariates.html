<p>This is typically material that characterizes your subjects:
<ul>
    <li> Age, Gender, Height, Weight, specific Preexisting

        Health Issues relevant to the project, etc.</li>

    <li>For any study, this is critical to knowing whether your groups are

        comparable except for the intervention of interest, or whether your

        subjects (and hence your findings) are consistent with other

        published studies. For all studies, it is critical to characterize your

        study sample â€“ so that others will know whether your work applies to

        them. </li>

</ul>
