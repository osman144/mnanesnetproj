<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Narrative Protocol
</h1>

<p>
    In essence, this is the “methods section” for your eventual paper.

    It should be “chronologic” (first we do this, then we do that....).

    I should be detailed so that someone else can easily “visualize” what

    your doing. But beware, IRB’s sometimes misinterpret things and

    may confuse “experiment” for “routine care”. If everyone in your

    study population already gets and arterial catheter placed routinely,

    just say “blood pressure will be recorded from routinely placed arterial

    catheters” (so IRB doesn’t get into “do you need experimental

    consent to place an arterial catheter?”). Spell out in clear terms

    WHEN drugs and interventions will take place and when

    measurements will be taken in the course of the study.
