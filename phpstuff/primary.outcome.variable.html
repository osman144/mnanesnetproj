<ul>
    <li>All studies require an unambiguous, specific, measurable, Primary Outcome

    Variable. The primary outcome variable is defined IN ADVANCE of starting the

    study (for very good statistical reasons that are beyond the scope of this summary).

    Your primary question/hypothesis (below) and your sample size calculations will be

    based almost entirely on this variable. Think long and hard about this – this and

    your primary hypothesis are the two key’s to successful research – and you can’t

    have one without the other.</li>


    <li>The words “unambiguous”, “specific” and “measurable” are critically important. If I

    said “my primary outcome variable is “blood pressure”, I would be completely wrong;

    it doesn’t meet any of the 3 word requirements. What blood pressure (systolic,

    diastolic, mean)? Measured how (arterial catheter, manual cuff etc.)? Measured

    when? If I said “Systolic blood pressure measured by an automated cuff 10
        minutes after drug administration with the patient in a supine position” we would probably be OK.</li>
