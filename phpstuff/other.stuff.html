<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Exclusion Criteria
</h1>

<p>
<ul>
    <li>
    This should be self-explanatory. But be honest and as
    accurate as possible. If you need the help of an RA
    think carefully about how much time will be needed
    per patient for the tasks that are needed. Don’t forget
    the “obligatory admin time”.</li>

<li>
    I may take 30min to consent a patient – but how many
    patient records and how much time are need to be
    reviewed to IDENTIFY an eligible patient?
</li>

<li>
    It may take 1hr to gather the data on a patient – but if
    the RA is going to enter this into your database, how
    much time will that take? Is the RA time “feasible”?</li>
</ul>
