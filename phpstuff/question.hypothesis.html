<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Question and Hypothesis
</h1>

<p><ul>
    <li>
    This is where you put your primary outcome measure – and perhaps secondary outcomes – into a formal statement
    of what you want to do. Basically you take your primary outcome and combine it with a statement of, for example,
    how big of a change you are looking for. Like the primary outcome the words unambiguous, specific and
    measurable applying. This is easy to get wrong.</li>

    <li>For example, “We wish to know if Drug A results in a lower blood pressure than Drug B” is NOT a testable
    hypothesis. It’s missing a definition of “blood pressure”, it doesn’t address “how much lower” and says nothing
        about the conditions of measurement.</li>

    <li>By contrast, “We hypothesize that Drug A will result in a 20mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure as measured
        by cuff 10 minutes after drug administration as compared with Drug B.” would be appropriate.</li>

    <li>MAJOR CAVEAT: Be careful about the differences between groups that you hypothesize. The smaller the
    projected differences, the bigger the sample size (see below). And the magnitude of the difference should be
    “clinically meaningful”. You COULD design a study to detect a 5mmHg difference in blood pressure (really large) –
        but would anyone really care?? Ask you’re colleagues “how much of a BP difference would matter to you”?</li>

    <li>This is pretty easy for prospective multi-group studies – and is trickier for other study types. But ALL studies
        start with a formal hypothesis (except, perhaps pilot studies).</li>
</ul>
