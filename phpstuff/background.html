<p>Every project starts with a thorough review of the literature, to find out what has previously been done in the relevant
    area. Emphasis on “thorough” – it takes more than just typing a few words into PubMed. You’d be amazed at how
    much stuff was done in the “very old days” (pre-1960), only some of which may appear in PubMed. And don’t just
    rely on displayed Abstracts – download the articles and read them! In many cases, there are key items in the text
    that ARE NOT reflected by the abstract, and in an unfortunately number of cases, the abstracts are simple wrong.
    But you can be sure that the editors/reviewers in the better journals are going to have some familiarity with this old
    stuff – and the fastest way to a rejection is to simply duplicate something that has already been done. </p>

    <p>A literature review can also be a great way to gather information to help you with your statistics, e.g. to define the
    variability around a mean in a given population, or to give you an idea of the magnitude of some drug effect etc.

    There is a great saying that “anything not worth doing is not worth doing well….” They key to avoiding this is a
    good literature search.</p>
<p>
    And background work can go beyond the literature. For example, you can look at medical record information
    from this institution. How many cases of X were done in the last month? How old were the patients?? What was
    the mean and SD of their pre-induction blood pressure/heart rate? This kind of information can really help you out.
    You can also look at “standard Epic reports” – or you could ask the Epic people to build one for you (OK if you only
    need information on such standard displays). And OPENING 10 of those patient records to look more closely is
    also OK – although you might think about opening 100.
