<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Exclusion Criteria
</h1>

<p>
Also usually straightforward.


But I’ve seen more nonsense in exclusion criteria than I care to
count.


Be reasonable. It isn’t necessary to say “we’re going to exclude
patients on LVADs” if your doing a simple regional anesthesia study
in the ASC! Stick with the exclusion criteria that you’re likely to
encounter in real life.


Yes, you’ll run into someone with characteristics that ARE NOT on
your exclusion list. As long as these are “uncommon or unexpected”,
you can still exclude them without their being on the list.
