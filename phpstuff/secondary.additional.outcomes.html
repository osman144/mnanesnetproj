<body>
<p>
    We always gather additional information (other than the primary outcome variable) during any

    study. Some of this information is needed to characterize your patient sample (age, gender etc –

    see below). Other information is to allow you to answer a variety of important SECONDARY

    HYPOTHESIS. For example, we might want to know HEART RATE as measured 10min after drug

    administration. Or diastolic blood pressure. Or cardiac output as measured by thermodiltution.

    <b>But be careful!</b> <b><u>Woolson’s Rule</u></b> says “If you don’t know what to do with a value, don’t collect it”.

    DO NOT list 50 “possible things that might turn out to be interesting”. Focus on factors that you and

    your colleagues would generally accept as relevant to the topic of interest. [The corollary of

    Woolson’s rule is “the more information you try to collect, the poorer the quality of the information

    you get...” (information fatigue). ] If your study is intended to examine the cardiovascular effects of

    a drug, then gather key cardiovascular variables. You probably don’t need to collect endocrine or

    renal or hepatic or mental health-related information, unless there is a priori reason to believe that

    this drug might have an important impact on such variables – and that impact is somehow linked to

    the drugs cardiovascular actions. And yes, when you get done, you’ll kick yourself for NOT

    recording something. This happens with every good study. But the list of things that “might be

    interesting” is infinite – and you can ruin a good study by trying to gather too much.
