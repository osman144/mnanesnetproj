<h1 style = "text-align:center;">Sample Size Justification</h1>

<p>
<ul><li>A sample size estimate must be based on your best

    guesstimate (based on real information) of the

    average/median value of your control variable, the

    variance around that central tendency, the magnitude

    of the effect you hope to see (and prove), the POWER

    you wish to have to detect that effect-size (usually 0.8

    or 0.9) and the p-value that you are going to accept

    (usually 0.05).</li>

    <li>For observational single group studies, start thinking

    in terms of confidence intervals around an observed

        incidence. If unsure â€“ talk to the statistician.</li>
